# ObjectExtractor

this is our final year academic project, 

The object extractor is tools which utilise the YOLO and U2 net models for extraction of objects from the image.

This repo consist our android project file, which have tf-lite version of the all models also there is white-box cartoonization model (again as tf-lite model) as it was an optional feature.

by direct cloning of this project and running in android, you may find the accuracy is lowered. it is because of the conversion to the tf-lite models. we recommed you to please optimise the process of converting in to tf-lite models from your side by using methods like quantization and then replace tf-lite files with your optimized tf-lite files for better results.
